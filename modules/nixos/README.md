# NixOS Modules

## Modularization
/*
All `.nix` files in this directory (except `default.nix`) are automatically imported by `default.nix`. To add new system configuration modules (e.g., `audio.nix`, `networking.nix`, `virtualization.nix`), simply add them here and they will be included automatically.

- Keep modules focused on a single topic for clarity and maintainability.
- Add a comment at the top of each module describing its purpose.
